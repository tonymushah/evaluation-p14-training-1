# Evaluation P14 Traning

It's the repo for my internship exam training for the first week of June 2024.

## Tech Stack

### Database

I use [PostgreSQL][psql] as a Database.

### Backend

I use [Rust][rust], [Diesel][diesel] as an ORM, [Actix Web][actix-web] as a web server and [Async GraphQL][async-graphql] as an API Layer.

### Frontend

I use [Svelte][svelte] (to be precise [Svelte Kit]) as a frontend framework, [TailwindCSS][tailwind] for the styling and [urql] as a connector to the backend.

## Backstory

No time for that... Maybe later
